Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX) program that resembles the Linux/Unix 
locate program.
Indexes all files on one or more disks and stores them in a database. 
Allows for searching on e.g. filename, hash, title (mp3 files), permissions 
(*nix),...

Useful to compare e.g. two cds and find the missing files or compare two files 
on different disks to see if they are the same - without having to have the 
disks handy.

Developed using FreePascal and Firebird database.
